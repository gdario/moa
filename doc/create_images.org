** Issues

*** What is the best way to conver a NumPy array to an image?

- What type of normalization should be used on each feature?
- And on each instance?

*** Creating a preprocessing function

The main problem is that the column transformer must be fitted on the training test set only and that ~.fit_transform()~ should be used on both the training and test, which is not so obvious in a function that is supposed to receive either data frame as an argument.
